Trouble-shooting the Book

Throughout the creation of plot book, I have come across a lot of problems. Listed below are any issues that may arise and the solutions to fix them.

Problem: Script is running slow. Should I wait it out or kill the operation?
Solution: This one can be kind of tricky. Because certain chapters include hefty amounts of text (example: chapter 3), it can take a while before anything happens. A good general assessment would be to wait, but if nothing happens after 5 minutes, kill the operation. Sometimes when the process it stuck, it will need you to log end the task through task manager.

If the book ever seems to be running slow or just isn't cooperating at all, check to see if either R or RStudio need to be updated. That usually seems to be the cause for any slowness.
