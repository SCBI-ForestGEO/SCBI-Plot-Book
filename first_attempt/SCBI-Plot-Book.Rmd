# Chapter 1: Introduction
Forests make up 45% of terrestrial carbon (Bonan 2008 and Stovall et al. 2018). The amount of carbon held in by trees can have a negative impact due to the emissions that are released into the air caused by deforestation. The rise in carbon emissions is attributed to the rise in tree mortality.

Mortality is one of the most important causes of forest dynamics (Gonzalez-Akre et al. 2016), as it can influnce the number and distribution of woody species that are found in an area. It can also be detrimental because tree mortality can be used as an indication of climate change (Gonzalez-Akre 2016).


In 1974, the Smithsonian purchased a piece of land, known as the Remount Depot. Shortly after the purchase, the land became the Conservation Research Center.The Front Royal site of the National Zoological Park is ~1,296 hectares (3,500 acres) and combined with research and academic facilities, forestry, pastures, and animal enclosures (ASK ERIKA OR KRISTA HOW TO CITE THE CULTURAL RESOUCE ASSESSMENT - Ayers et al. 2007).


# Chapter 2: Physical Environment
The dynamic plot is located at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Virginia, U.S.A (38°53'36.6"N, 78°08'43.4"W) with the elevation ranging from 273m to 338m (Gozalez-Akre et al. 2016). The research site is a temperate deciduous forest within a 25.6-hectare plot set up 640m by 400m (Bourg et al. 2013).

This part of the document will be describing the research site. This part should include climate (include graph used in mortality paper), topography (graphs created by Ian), and soil information

**I think it would be beneficial to include figure 2 from Stovall et al. 2018**
"The top 10 domintant species contributing over 80% of biomass within the ForestGEO forest as estimated using the Chonjnacky et al. (2014) equations."


# Chapter 3: Methods
This survey was conducted in the Center for Tropical Forest Science-Forest Global Earth Observatory's (CTFS-ForestGEO) dynamic forest plot. The plot, itself, is located at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia, USA. SCBI is 3.1 miles (5 kilometers) from the Shenandoah National Park and roughly 80 miles (~130 kilometers) from the Smithsonian National Zoological Park.

The research was conducted by a team of interns under the labs of William McShea, Ph.D and Kristina Anderson-Teixeira, Ph.D. On average, 3.3 people/day participated in the census with 3.7 field days/week. A single person logged an average of 29 hours/week, resulting in 97 hours/week being done. Roughly 3,200 total amount of work hours - including data collection, review, entry, and analysis - was completed.

The survey team utilized methods set by the Center for Tropical Forest Science - Forest Global Earth Observatory, also known as CTFS-ForestGEO (Condit 1998 and Gonzalez-Akre et al. 2016). Measurements of old, new multi-, and new plant stems are either measured or recruited at "\???1"cm DBH (Bourg et al. 2013). "Old stems" are considered to be stems that existed in the previous census. These measurements also include old multistemed species. "New multi stems" are new stems that have grown on the same woody species as the old stem. "New plant stems" are the new growth of species that have not been tagged in the plot yet. "Tagging" is when a woody species is marked with a specific identification number. These numbers are compiled within a spread sheet and logged into the global CTFS database.


Gonzalez-Akre et al. 2016:
- Dead stems are considered to be dead due to the following criteria: (1) stems that are broken below DBH; (2) loosened or detached bark; (3) lack of development in regards to flower or leaf buds and; (4) signs of pests or pathogens such as fungus and insects.

Ramage et al. 2017:
- 4 hectares of the plot is fenced in to keep out *Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) - area will further be refered to as the deer exclosure

Give credit to Bourg et al. 2013:
- measured and recruited all stems "\???1"cm DBH
- recruitment includes tagging and identification of stems



# Chapter 4: Woody Plants
For life history, mention common canopy positions
  - information from Ramage et al. 2017
    - dominant canopy are *Liriondendron tulipifera* (tulip poplar), *Carya* spp., *Quercus* spp., *Fraxinus americana* (white ash), *Nyssa sylvatica* (black gum)

# Chapter 5: Biotic Drivers of Change
## Invasive Plants
(insert Caroline's information here - should include description/life history, native range, range in US, spread in pot, and data from the Shenandoah paper)

## Invasive Species and Pathogens
(expand on data found in Shenandoah paper)

## Impact of Deer and Plant Ecology
(Bill's section - include that the deer exclosure has also led to greater numbers of species)

## Interspecies Competition
(could talk about how different species fight for available space, i.e. tree fall gaps)
