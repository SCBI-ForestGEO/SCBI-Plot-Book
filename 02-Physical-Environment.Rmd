# Physical Environment

The dynamic plot is located at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Virginia, U.S.A (38 degrees 53'36.6"N, 78 degrees 08'43.4"W) with the elevation ranging from 273m to 338m (Gozalez-Akre et al. 2016). The research site is a temperate deciduous forest within a 25.6-hectare plot set up 640m by 400m (Bourg et al. 2013).

This part of the document will be describing the research site. This part should include climate (include graph used in mortality paper), topography (graphs created by Ian), and soil information

**I think it would be beneficial to include figure 2 from Stovall et al. 2018**
"The top 10 domintant species contributing over 80% of biomass within the ForestGEO forest as estimated using the Chonjnacky et al. (2014) equations."
