# Chapter 1: Introduction
In 1974, the Smithsonian purchased a piece of land, known as the Remound Depot. Shortly after the purchase, the land became the Conservation Research Center.

- TALK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT, INFLUENTIAL, AND DETRIMENTAL MORTALITY IS
- bring up how detrimental it is now so that you can bring it up later in chapter 5

Pull information from Gonzalez-Akre et al. 2016

Stovall et al. 2018:
- forests make up 45% of terrestrial carbon (Bonan 2008)
  - The amount of carbon held in by trees can have a negative impact due to the emissions that are released into the air caused by deforestation.


# Chapter 2: Physical Environment

This part of the document will be describing the research site. This part should include climate (include graph used in mortality paper), topography (graphs created by Ian), and soil information

Give credit to Bourg et al. 2013:
- 25.6 hectacres (640m x 400m)
- woody stem census
- temperate deciduous forest located in Front Royal, VA, USA
- measured and recruited all stems "\<= 1"cm DBH
- recruitment includes tagging and identification of stems

Gonzalez-Akre et al. 2016:
- elevation = 273-338m

Ramage et al. 2017:
- location of SCBI is 38?53'36.6"N, 78?08'43.4"W

**I think it would be beneficial to include figure 2 from Stovall et al. 2018**
"The top 10 domintant species contributing over 80% of biomass within the ForestGEO forest as estimated using the Chonjnacky et al. (2014) equations."


# Chapter 3: Methods
This survey was conducted in the Center for Tropical Forest Science-Forest Global Earth Observatory's (CTFS-ForestGEO) dynamic forest plot. The plot, itself, is located at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia, USA. SCBI is 3.1 miles (5 kilometers) from the Shenandoah National Park and roughly 80 miles (~130 kilometers) from the Smithsonian National Zoological Park.

Gonzalez-Akre et al. 2016 and Condit 1998:
- methods set by the Center for Tropical Forest Science - Forest Global Earth Observatory

Gonzalez-Akre et al. 2016:
- Dead stems are considered to be dead due to the following criteria: (1) stems that are broken below DBH; (2) loosened or detached bark; (3) lack of development in regards to flower or leaf buds and; (4) signs of pests or pathogens such as fungus and insects.

Ramage et al. 2017:
- 4 hectares of the plot is fenced in to keep out *Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) - area will further be refered to as the deer exclosure


# Chapter 4: Tree Species
For life history, mention common canopy positions
  - information from Ramage et al. 2017
    - dominant canopy are *Liriondendron tulipifera* (tulip poplar), *Carya* spp., *Quercus* spp., *Fraxinus americana* (white ash), *Nyssa sylvatica* (black gum)

# Chapter 5: Biotic Drivers of Change
## Invasive Plants
(insert Caroline's information here - should include description/life history, native range, range in US, spread in pot, and data from the Shenandoah paper)

## Invasive Species and Pathogens
(expand on data found in Shenandoah paper)

## Impact of Deer and Plant Ecology
(Bill's section - include that the deer exclosure has also led to greater numbers of species)

## Interspecies Competition
(could talk about how different species fight for available space, i.e. tree fall gaps)
