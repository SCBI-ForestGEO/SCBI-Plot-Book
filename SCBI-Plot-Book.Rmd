# Chapter 1: Introduction
In 1974, the Smithsonian purchased a piece of land, known as the Remound Depot. Shortly after the purchase, the land became the Conservation Research Center.

- TALK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT, INFLUENTIAL, AND DETRIMENTAL MORTALITY IS
- bring up how detrimental it is now so that you can bring it up later in chapter 5

Pull information from Gonzalez-Akre et al. 2016

Stovall et al. 2018:
- forests make up 45% of terretrial carbon (Bonan 2008)

# Chapter 2: Physical Environment

This part of the document will be describing the research site. This part should include climate (include graph used in mortality paper), topography (graphs created by Ian), and soil information

Give credit to Bourg et al. 2013:
- 25.6 hectacres (640m x 400m)
- woody stem census
- temperate deciduous forest located in Front Royal, VA, USA
- measured and recruited all stems â‰¥1cm DBH
- recruitment includes tagging and identification of stems

Gonzalez-Akre et al. 2016:
elevation = 273-338m

# Chapter 3: Methods
This survey was conducted in the Center for Tropical Forest Science-Forest Global Earth Observatory's (CTFS-ForestGEO) dynamic forest plot. The plot, itself, is located at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia, USA. SCBI is 3.1 miles (5 kilometers) from the Shenandoah National Park and roughly 80 miles (~130 kilometers) from the Smithsonian National Zoological Park.

Gonzalez-Akre et al. 2016 and Condit 1998:
- methods set by the Center for Tropical Forest Science - Forest Global Earth Observatory

Gonzalez-Akre et al. 2016:
- Dead stems are considered to be dead due to the following criteria: (1) stems that are broken below DBH; (2) loosened or detached bark; (3) lack of development in regards to flower or leaf buds and; (4) signs of pests or pathogens such as fungus and insects.

# Chapter 5: Biotic Drivers of Change
## Invasive Plants
(insert Caroline's information here - should include description/life history, native range, range in US, spread in pot, and data from the Shenandoah paper)

## Invasive Species and Pathogens
(expand on data found in Shenandoah paper)

## Impact of Deer and Plant Ecology
(Bill's section)

# Chapter 6: Carbon Cycling
(take it away Krista!)
