# Ideas

This is a file to record ideas for book content (very preliminary at this point). 
More or less this is will be the chapter organization

- ### Chapter 1. Introduction
  -History of plot, Ian ideas..
  
- ### Chapter 2. Pysical environment
  - climate (expand and update graph published in mortality paper)
  - topography (three dimensional map of plot, maybe Ian can build in GIS or find a script)
  - soils (Check Shen et al. 2016 for what they publish on soil at SCBI)

- ### Chapter 3. Methods (not sure if this would be a chapter by itself)
  -* I am not sure if here we will include/cite methods for many of the other measuments that are taken in our plot.
  
- Tree census
  - field methods: describe site specifics, multistesm issues, summirize person-hours invested. Include here challenges in the field (i.e. marking multistems) and suggestions to improve (survey planing, where to start- i.e. denser areas, etc)
  
  - data management:
      - Double data entry efforts, volunteer force: XXX hours (cite data managment CTFS guide)
      - Data review before being entered. We invested xx of hrs to check xxxxx records and cough XXX of errors
      - Data quality assessment: In-house curation before submitting to CTFS
      - Regular data backup, requested backups from central data manager, wrote R script for quick DQA 
 

- ### Chapter 4. Tree species (largest portion of book)
  - Species life history (Michael Scott to lead and chime in), main descriptions from FloraVA
  - distribution maps
  - stats and simple graphs on abundance, growth, mortality (by size)
  - architecture (e.g., allometries for height, biomass, sapwood,...)
  - leaf traits
  - age distribution from cores
  - climate sensitivity from cores ("quilt" showing multiple climate variables)
  - mortality rates through time & drivers of mortality
  - contributions to biomass and ANPP

- ### Chapter 5. Biotic drivers of change (anthropogenic)
  - invasive plants (see Shen et al 2016, we are expanding on her data, she used 2009,10 and 11 I think). Caroline Kittle to lead the chapter.
  - invasive pests & pathogens: use Shenandoah paper info, expand upon it
  - deer impact on plant ecology (this will be mostly mcShea existing work, maybe we can include simple analysis in/out exclusure?)
- carbon cycling: Teixeira to expand, use carbon calculator??

Others ideas:
- Plant phylogeny (GENBank data)
- Insect data from Malaise trap??
