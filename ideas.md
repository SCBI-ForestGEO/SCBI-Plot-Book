  - architecture (e.g., allometries for height, biomass, sapwood,...)
  - leaf traits
  - age distribution from cores
  - climate sensitivity from cores ("quilt" showing multiple climate variables)
  - drivers of mortality
- biotic drivers of change (anthropogenic)
  - invasive plants
  - deer
  - invasive pests & pathogens
