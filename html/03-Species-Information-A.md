##Adoxaceae

### *Sambucus canadensis var. canadensis* (L.) R. Bolli
#### Common Elderberry
Deciduous shrub with white flowers, green opposite compound leaves, and deep violet to blackish fruit. Leaflets are serrate, with 1cm petiolule and 3-10cm petioles. These shrubs live in damp soils located along roadsides, clearings, fields, and swamps.
