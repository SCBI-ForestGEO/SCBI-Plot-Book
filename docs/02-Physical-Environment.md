# Physical Environment

## Geographic location
The SCBI ForestGEO Large Forest Dynamics Plot is located within the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Virginia, USA (38$^\circ$ 53'36.6"N, 78$^\circ$ 08'43.4"W) located at the intersection of the Blue Ridge, Ridge and Valley, and Piedmont physiographic provinces and to the northwest of the Shenandoah National Park (Figure 1). Elevations range from 273 to 338 meters above sea level (masl) with a topographic relief of 65m [@bourg_initial_2013].

## Climate
The SBI plot is located in a mature (> 100 year) and young (< 40 year) secondary secondary mixed deciduous forest, with a mean annual temperature of 12$^\circ$C and a mean annual precipitation of 1001 mm (data from 2009-2014 based on a local weather station located just outside the plot). According to the Koppen-Geiger biome classifcation, the plot falls within the Cfa zone, characterized as humid subtropical/midlatitude with significant precipitation year-round.Primary natural disturbances at the plot consist of wind and ice storms [@andersonteixeira_ctfs-forestgeo:_2015]. 


*Potential data to include:*
- SCBI weather tower
- NEON


Climate data from the weather tower adjancet to the plot and managed by primary investigators can be access through a public GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Met_Station_Data/SCBI). Other multiple climatic data products are also available in the NEON website for the SCBI core site [here](https://data.neonscience.org/browse-data?siteCode=SCBI)

## Soils
*Potential data to include:*
- Data collected by Ben Turner
- NEON data

## Hydrology?
*Potential data to include:*
- NEON has relevant data (Posey STREON site)
