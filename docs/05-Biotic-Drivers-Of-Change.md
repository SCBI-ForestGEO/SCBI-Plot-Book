# Biotics Drivers of Change

## Invasive Plants

This initiative started as part of the regional effort for the study of the long-term effect of white-tail deer on the dispersion of invasive plants across the mid-Atlantic forest (Shen, 2016). 
The surveys have been conducted in 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2018. We aim to record the number or coverage of invasive plants present at 640 unique 20x20 m quadrats within the 26.4 ha plot. For woody plants, we count the individual stems and for exotic herbaceous species we visually estimate their cover (in %) within a quadrat. 

Expansion to include more species in 2014
Woody species. Descriptions in Chapter 3, if not, include it here.

(dscription should include life history, native range, range in US, spread in plot)

## Invasive Pest and Pathogens
(expand on data found in Shenandoah paper)

## Impact of Deer and Plant Ecology
(Bill's section - include that the deer exclosure has also led to greater numbers of species)

## Interspecies Competition
(could talk about how different species fight for available space, i.e. tree fall gaps)
