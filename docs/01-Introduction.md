# Introduction

Located at the [Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/conservation) (SCBI) is a large forest dynamics plot. This plot is a part of the [Forest Global Earth Observatory](https://forestgeo.si.edu/) (ForestGEO), a worldwide initiative established from the global networking of scientists and forest research sites. With the dedication of these people and the information coming from these sites, long-term studies of the world's forest can be achieved.

In 1974, the Smithsonian purchased a piece of land, known as the Remount Depot. Shortly after the purchase, the land became the Conservation Research Center. The Front Royal site of the National Zoological Park is ~1,296 hectares (3,500 acres) and combined with research and academic facilities, forestry, pastures, and animal enclosures (ASK ERIKA OR KRISTA HOW TO CITE THE CULTURAL RESOUCE ASSESSMENT - Ayers et al. 2007).
