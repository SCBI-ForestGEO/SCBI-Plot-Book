# Introduction

The [Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/conservation) (SCBI) Large Forest Dynamics Plot is part of the [Forest Global Earth Observatory](https://forestgeo.si.edu/) (ForestGEO), a worldwide initiative established by a global network of forest scientists being the only monitoring forest network applying standarized methods at all terrestrial biomes [@andersonteixeira_ctfs-forestgeo:_2015]


Our site has a renowned history within the historic military context in the area because of its role associated with training animals for  armyâ€™s use. Originally called the *Front Royal Quartermaster Remount Depot* with land prominently comprised of pastures and forest patches, it functioned as a federal facility which produced horses and mules for cavalry units (**REF1**). 
Within the original purchased land in 1909 (2,077 ha or 5,132 acres) lies the *Posey Field* where the plot is located, this area was considered the best timber site within the Depot (Sunquist 1982). In 1948, the land was transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a cattle breeding station which was discontinued in 1973 to later be transferred to the National Zoological Park of the Smithsonian Institution in 1975. (**REF1**). 
Currently, the forest habitat on the SCBI site is secondary forest, is part of the expansive Eastern Deciduous Forest and lies within the Oak-Chestnut/Appalachian Oak region, which includes the ridges of the Appalachian mountain range from northern Georgia to southern Maine in the USA [@bourg_initial_2013].
The Front Royal campus, which houses SCBI expands 1,296 hectares (3,200 acres) and combines research and academic facilities, forested areas, pastures, and animal enclosures. The SCBI is a leading institution focusing to save wildlife species from extinction and train future generations of conservationists.
