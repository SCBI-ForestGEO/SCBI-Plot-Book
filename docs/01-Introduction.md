# Introduction

The [Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/conservation) (SCBI) Large Forest Dynamics Plot is part of the [Forest Global Earth Observatory](https://forestgeo.si.edu/) (ForestGEO), a worldwide initiative established by a global network of forest scientists being the only monitoring forest network applying standardized  methods at all terrestrial biomes [@andersonteixeira_ctfs-forestgeo:_2015]. The SCBI plot was stablished in the spring of 2008, the second USA plot within the [Temperate Program]( https://forestgeo.si.edu/research-programs/temperate-forests) at ForestGEO. 

Our site has a renowned history among the historic military context in the area due to its role as animal training facility for armyâ€™s use. Originally called the *Front Royal Quartermaster Remount Depot* with land prominently comprised of pastures and forest patches, it functioned as a federal facility which produced horses and mules for cavalry units [@ayers_saint_goss_cultural_2007].

Within the original purchased land in 1909 (2,077 ha or 5,132 acres) lies the *Posey Field* where the plot is located, this area was considered the best timber site in the Depot [@sunquist_preliminary_1982]. In 1948, the land was transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a cattle breeding station which was discontinued in 1973 to later be transferred to the National Zoological Park of the Smithsonian Institution in 1975 [@ayers_saint_goss_cultural_2007]. The land has been prevented from logging and other severe human disturbances since then. 

The Front Royal campus, which houses SCBI, expands 1,296 hectares (3,200 acres) and combines research and academic facilities, undisturbed forested areas, pastures, and animal enclosures. The SCBI is a global leading institution focusing to save endangered wildlife species from extinction and training future generations of conservationists.
