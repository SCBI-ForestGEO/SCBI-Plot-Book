Elevations range from 273 to 338 meters above sea level (masl) with a topographic relief of 65m (Bourg et al. 2013). Figure 1. Location of the SCBI ForestGEO Large Forest Dynamics Plot 2.2 Climate The SBI plot is located in a mature (&gt; 100 year) and young (&lt; 40 year) secondary secondary mixed deciduous forest, with a mean annual temperature of 12\\(^\\circ\\)C and a mean annual precipitation of 1001 mm (data from 2009-2014 based on a local weather station located just outside the plot). According to the Koppen-Geiger biome classifcation, the plot falls within the Cfa zone, characterized as humid subtropical/midlatitude with significant precipitation year-round.Primary natural disturbances at the plot consist of wind and ice storms (Anderson‐Teixeira et al. 2015). Potential data to include: - SCBI weather tower - NEON Climate data from the weather tower adjancet to the plot and managed by primary investigators can be access through a public GitHub repository here. Other multiple climatic data products are also available in the NEON website for the SCBI core site here 2.3 Soils Potential data to include: - Data collected by Ben Turner - NEON data 2.4 Hydrology? Potential data to include: - NEON has relevant data (Posey STREON site) Teixeira et al. 2015 References "]
