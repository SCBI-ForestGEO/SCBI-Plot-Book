The amount of carbon held in by trees can have a negative impact due to the emissions that are released into the air caused by deforestation. The rise in carbon emissions is attributed to the rise in tree mortality. 4.1 Carbon Cycling 4.2 Tree Mortality Dynamics 4.3 Climate Sensitivity References "]
