["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) Large Forest Dynamics Plot is part of the Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO), a worldwide initiative established by a global network of forest scientists being the only monitoring forest network applying standardized methods at all terrestrial biomes (Anderson‐Teixeira et al. 2015). The SCBI plot was stablished in the spring of 2008, the second USA plot within the Temperate Program at ForestGEO. Our site has a renowned history among the historic military context in the area due to its role as animal training facility for army’s use. Originally called the Front Royal Quartermaster Remount Depot with land prominently comprised of pastures and forest patches, it functioned as a federal facility which produced horses and mules for cavalry units (Ayers Saint Goss 2007). Within the original purchased land in 1909 (2,077 ha or 5,132 acres) lies the Posey Field where the plot is located, this area was considered the best timber site in the Depot (Sunquist 1982). In 1948, the land was transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a cattle breeding station which was discontinued in 1973 to later be transferred to the National Zoological Park of the Smithsonian Institution in 1975 (Ayers Saint Goss 2007). The land has been prevented from logging and other severe human disturbances since then. The Front Royal campus, which houses SCBI, expands 1,296 hectares (3,200 acres) and combines research and academic facilities, undisturbed forested areas, pastures, and animal enclosures. The SCBI is a global leading institution focusing to save endangered wildlife species from extinction and training future generations of conservationists. References "],
["physical-environment.html", "Chapter 2 Physical Environment 2.1 Geographic location 2.2 Climate", " Chapter 2 Physical Environment 2.1 Geographic location The SCBI ForestGEO Large Forest Dynamics Plot is located within the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Virginia, USA (38\\(^\\circ\\) 53’36.6“N, 78\\(^\\circ\\) 08’43.4”W) located at the intersection of the Blue Ridge, Ridge and Valley, and Piedmont physiographic provinces and to the northwest of the Shenandoah National Park (Fig. 1).The site lies in the core Oak-Chestnut/Appalachian Oak region, which includes the ridges of the Appalachian mountain range from northern Georgia to southern Maine in the USA (Bourg et al. 2013). The dimensions of the 25.6 ha SCBI plot are 640 x 400 meters, divided on a grid of 640 20 x 20 meters quadrats. Located at the south-east corner of the plot, there is a 4-ha fenced area erected in 1990 to exclude white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). This deer exclusion area has been part of a regional study on deer impacts in forest communities and invasive plants dispersion (Averill et al. 2017; Bourg et al. 2017; Heckel et al. 2010; McShea and Rappole 1992; McGarvey et al. 2013). Elevations range from 273 to 338 meters above sea level (masl) with a topographic relief of 65m (Fig. 1, insert) Figure 1. Location of the SCBI ForestGEO Large Forest Dynamics Plot 2.2 Climate The SBI plot is located in a mature (&gt; 100 year) and young (&lt; 40 year) secondary mixed deciduous forest, with a mean annual temperature of 12\\(^\\circ\\)C and a mean annual precipitation of 1001 mm (data from 2009-2014 based on a local weather station located just outside the plot). According to the Koppen-Geiger biome classifcation, the plot falls within the Cfa zone, characterized as humid subtropical/midlatitude with significant precipitation year-round. Natural disturbances at the plot consist primarily of wind and ice storms (Anderson‐Teixeira et al. 2015). Climate data from the weather tower adjancet to the plot and managed by primary investigators can be access through a public GitHub repository here. Other multiple climatic data products are also available in the NEON website for the SCBI core site here References "],

Species names are arranged alphabetically by family and species; species scientific name, authorship, and common names follow the Flora of Virginia conventions (Weakley, Ludwig, and Townsend 2012). If a synonym for a species name is given, then it is written after the symbol “=” below the species name used in the plot. The following are the main descriptors used for each species. Botanical descriptions: All species in the plot were given a brief technical plant description summarized from the Flora of Virginia (Weakley, Ludwig, and Townsend 2012) and the “Common Native Trees of Virginia” guide (Powell 2007). Ecological aspects were subtracted from various sources (Weakley, Ludwig, and Townsend 2012; Missouri Botanical Garden n.d.). Local habitat and species distribution refer to those within the plot. Stratum: Indicates the main canopy position of the species based on the diameter of the species measured at the SCBI plot and by qualitative observations within the forest. Native status: Indicates if the plant species is native or introduced to Virginia (Weakley, Ludwig, and Townsend 2012). Conservation status: Conservation status follows the standards from the IUCN Red List categories (Standards and Petitions Sub-Committee 2016): Least Concern: populations stable or taxon that do not qualify as threatened. Near threatened: taxon close to qualifying as threatened category in the near future). Vulnerable: A taxon considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. Endangered: A taxon considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. Critically endangered: A taxon considered to be facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. Field code: Species code used in the field and data sets (first two letters of genus and first two letters of species). Summary statistics: A table summarizing basic statistics per species per census within the plot, include: number of individual (stems), new stems (total stems recruited and recruitment rate), stems dead and annual mortality rates, minimum and maximum DBH, mean growth rate for stems &lt; and &gt; 10 cm. Species distribution maps within plot: Distribution of each species within the 25.6 ha plot is illustrated in an individual topographic map (10-m contour lines). The blue lines represent 2 streams running North-South and East-West within the plot, the dotted red line represents a gravel road, and the black thick line represents a 4-ha deer exclusion established in 1990 (Bourg et al. 2013). Diameter for alive and dead stems stems are symbolized as follow: by a gradient color scale 1-10 cm DBH, green dot; 10.1-50 cm DBH, yellow dot; 50.1 cm DBH and above, blue dot; dead stems of any size, are represented by a black dot. The maps illustrate the species as surveyed in 2018. Species regional range: In the online version of this book, we present species range map for all species within the plot, except for Elaeagnus umbellata. Maps were sourced from the Botanical Information and Ecology Network (Botanical Information and Ecology Network n.d.) and depicts the distribution of the species globally. Pictures and graphs: A leaf or group of leaves images are shown for each species. Leaves were collected fresh, scanned flat and images enhanced using the software GIMP 2.10.8. A 2-cm scale is given in the lower right corner. Pictures of tree cores are shown when available. Those pictures were produced using an Epson Expression 12000XL Photo Scanner. Climate sensitivity graphs built from tree cores show the relationship between multiple climate variables and tree growth, those graphs are only shown for 12 species (see Helcoski et al. (2019) for methods to build graphs). 3.1 Adoxaceae Sambucus canadensis L. Common name: Common Elderberry. Species code: saca. Stratum: understory. Native. Conservation status: Least concern.

The amount of carbon held in by trees can have a negative impact due to the emissions that are released into the air caused by deforestation. The rise in carbon emissions is attributed to the rise in tree mortality. References "],

["methods.html", "Chapter 6 Methods", " Chapter 6 Methods As part of the ForestGEO network, at SCBI we follow the original stablished standardized protocols (Condit 1998) for tree measurements with few modifications. We have conducted three censuses, the initial census in 2008 (data and ancillary data published in (Bourg et al. 2013)), and two recensuses in 2013 and 2018. Roughly, 3200 work hours, including field collection, data review, and data entry were invested during each campaign. In summary, each stem greater than or equal to 1 cm DBH is measured, mapped and identified to species level. In each recensus, measurements of old, new, and multi-stems are conducted. Particularly at SCBI, when measuring multi-stemmed plants, each stem (up to 6 stems) are given a different colored wire/combination to indicate which stems is being measured. New plants are added to the database and a new tag number applied. References "],
