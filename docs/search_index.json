Species names are arranged alphabetically by family and species; species scientific name, authorship, and common names follow the Flora of Virginia conventions (Weakley et al, 2012). If a synonym for a species name is given, then it is written after the symbol “=” below the species name used in the plot. The following are the main descriptors used for each species. Botanical descriptions: All species in the plot were given a brief plant description summarized from the Flora of Virginia (Weakley et al, 2012). Ecological aspects were subtracted from various sources (Weakley et al, 2012, Missouri Botanical Garden, https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org). Habitat and distribution refer to those within the plot. Stratum: Indicates the main canopy position of the species based on the diameter of the species measured at the SCBI plot and by qualitative observations within the forest. Native status: Indicates if the plant species is native or introduced to Virginia (source Weakley et al, 2012). Conservation status: The conservation for each species follow the categories from the IUCN Red List categories (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee, 2017): Least Concern: populations stable or taxon that do not qualify as threatened. Near threatened: taxon close to qualifying as threatened category in the near future). Vulnerable: A taxon considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. Endangered: A taxon considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. Critically endangered: A taxon considered to be facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. Field code: Species code used in the field and data sets (first two letters of genus and first two letters of species). Summary statistics: A table summarizing basic statistics per species per census within the plot, include: number of individual (stems), new stems (total stems recruited and recruitment rate), stems dead and annual mortality rates, minimum and maximum DBH, mean growth rate for stems &lt; and &gt; 10 cm. Species distribution maps within plot: Distribution of each species within the 25.6 ha plot is illustrated in an individual topographic map (10-m contour lines). The blue lines represent 2 streams running S-N and W-E, the dotted line represents a gravel road, and the black line represents a 4ha deer exclusion stablished in 1990 (Bourg et al. 2013). Diameter for live stems are symbolized by a gradient color scale, dead stems are represented by a black dot. The maps illustrate the species as survey in 2018. Species regional range: In the online version of this book, we present species range map for all species within the plot, except for Elaeagnus umbellata. Maps were sourced from the Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN, version 4.1, http://bien.nceas.ucsb.edu/bien) and depicts the distribution of the species globally. Pictures and graphs: A leaf or group of leaves images are shown for each species. Leaves were collected fresh, scanned flat and images enhanced using the software GIMP 2.10.8. A 2-cm scale is given in the lower right corner. Pictures of tree cores are shown when available. Those pictures were produced using an Epson Expression 12000XL Photo Scanner. Climate sensitivity graphs built from tree cores show the relationship between multiple climate variables and tree growth, those graphs are only shown for 12 species (see Helckoski et al, 2019 for methods to build graphs).
