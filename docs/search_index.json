["methods.html", "Chapter 6 Methods", " Chapter 6 Methods As part of the ForestGEO network, at SCBI we follow the original stablished standardized protocols (Condit 1998) for tree measurements with few modifications. We have conducted three censuses, the initial census in 2008 (data and ancillary data published in (Bourg et al. 2013)), and two recensuses in 2013 and 2018. Roughly, 3200 work hours, including field collection, data review, and data entry were invested during each campaign. In summary, each stem greater than or equal to 1 cm DBH is measured, mapped and identified to species level. In each recensus, measurements of old, new, and multi-stems are conducted. Particularly at SCBI, when measuring multi-stemmed plants, each stem (up to 6 stems) are given a different colored wire/combination to indicate which stems is being measured. New plants are added to the database and a new tag number applied. References "]
