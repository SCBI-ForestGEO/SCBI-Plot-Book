["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) Large Forest Dynamics Plot is a part of the Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO), a worldwide initiative established from a global networking of scientists and forest research sites. In 1974, the Smithsonian purchased a piece of land, known as the Remount Depot. Shortly after the purchase, the land became the Conservation Research Center. The Front Royal site of the National Zoological Park is ~1,296 hectares (3,500 acres) and combined with research and academic facilities, forestry, pastures, and animal enclosures (ASK ERIKA OR KRISTA HOW TO CITE THE CULTURAL RESOUCE ASSESSMENT - Ayers et al. 2007).

Elevations range from 273 to 338 meters above sea level (masl) with a topographic relief of 65m (Bourg et al. 2013). Map of SCBI site relative to regional topography. Elevation in insert are in meters. The SCBI is within a region encompassing the northern section of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Appalachian Mountain range. The Shenandoah National Park (elevation range ~171 to ~1,234 masl) (???) lies directly to the southwest while smaller hills (of which the site is comprised) extend to the northwest. To the east of the site, the smaller hills give way to the lower Piedmont region, while in the west, they give way to the Shenandoah Valley under the Massanutten Mountains. Potential data to include: - NEON has topography, depth to water table, etc. 2.2 Climate The forest type across the 25.6-ha plot is homogeneously broadleaf, cold deciduous, with a mean annual temperature of 12.9 degrees C and a mean annual precipitation of 1001 mm. According to the Koppen-Geiger biome classifcation, the plot falls within the Cfa zone, characterized as humid subtropical/midlatitude with significant precipitation year-round. Primary disturbances at the SCBI ForestGEO Plot are natural and consist of wind and ice storms (Anderson‐Teixeira et al. 2015). Potential data to include: - SCBI weather tower - NEON - other (external) products here 2.3 Soils Potential data to include: - Data collected by Ben Turner - NEON data 2.4 Hydrology? Potential data to include: - NEON has relevant data (Posey STREON site) Teixeira et al. 2015 References "],

Species names are arranged alphabetically by family and species; species scientific name, authorship, and common names follow the Flora of Virginia conventions (Weakley, Ludwig, and Townsend 2012). If a synonym for a species name is given, then it is written after the symbol “=” below the species name used in the plot. The following are the main descriptors used for each species. Botanical descriptions: All species in the plot were given a brief technical plant description summarized from the Flora of Virginia (Weakley, Ludwig, and Townsend 2012) and the “Common Native Trees of Virginia” guide (Powell 2007). Ecological aspects were subtracted from various sources (Weakley, Ludwig, and Townsend 2012, noauthor_missouri_nodate). Local habitat and species distribution refer to those within the plot. Stratum: Indicates the main canopy position of the species based on the diameter of the species measured at the SCBI plot and by qualitative observations within the forest. Native status: Indicates if the plant species is native or introduced to Virginia (Weakley, Ludwig, and Townsend 2012). Conservation status: Conservation status follows the standards from the IUCN Red List categories (“Standards and Petitions Sub-Committee” 2016): Least Concern: populations stable or taxon that do not qualify as threatened. Near threatened: taxon close to qualifying as threatened category in the near future). Vulnerable: A taxon considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. Endangered: A taxon considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. Critically endangered: A taxon considered to be facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. Field code: Species code used in the field and data sets (first two letters of genus and first two letters of species). Summary statistics: A table summarizing basic statistics per species per census within the plot, include: number of individual (stems), new stems (total stems recruited and recruitment rate), stems dead and annual mortality rates, minimum and maximum DBH, mean growth rate for stems &lt; and &gt; 10 cm. Species distribution maps within plot: Distribution of each species within the 25.6 ha plot is illustrated in an individual topographic map (10-m contour lines). The blue lines represent 2 streams running North-South and East-West within the plot, the dotted red line represents a gravel road, and the black thick line represents a 4-ha deer exclusion established in 1990 (Bourg et al. 2013). Diameter for alive and dead stems stems are symbolized as follow: by a gradient color scale 1-10 cm DBH, green dot; 10.1-50 cm DBH, yellow dot; 50.1 cm DBH and above, blue dot; dead stems of any size, are represented by a black dot. The maps illustrate the species as surveyed in 2018. Species regional range: In the online version of this book, we present species range map for all species within the plot, except for Elaeagnus umbellata. Maps were sourced from the Botanical Information and Ecology Network (“Botanical Information and Ecology Network” n.d.) and depicts the distribution of the species globally. Pictures and graphs: A leaf or group of leaves images are shown for each species. Leaves were collected fresh, scanned flat and images enhanced using the software GIMP 2.10.8. A 2-cm scale is given in the lower right corner. Pictures of tree cores are shown when available. Those pictures were produced using an Epson Expression 12000XL Photo Scanner. Climate sensitivity graphs built from tree cores show the relationship between multiple climate variables and tree growth, those graphs are only shown for 12 species (see Helcoski et al. (2019) for methods to build graphs). 3.1 Adoxaceae Sambucus canadensis L. Common name: Common Elderberry. Species code: saca.

["methods.html", "Chapter 6 Methods", " Chapter 6 Methods This survey was conducted in the Center for Tropical Forest Science-Forest Global Earth Observatory’s (CTFS-ForestGEO) dynamic forest plot. The plot, itself, is located at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia, USA. SCBI is 3.1 miles (5 kilometers) from the Shenandoah National Park and roughly 80 miles (~130 kilometers) from the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. The research was conducted by a team of interns under the labs of William McShea, Ph.D and Kristina Anderson-Teixeira, Ph.D. On average, 3.3 people/day participated in the census with 3.7 field days/week. A single person logged an average of 29 hours/week, resulting in 97 hours/week being done. Roughly 3,200 total amount of work hours - including data collection, review, entry, and analysis - was completed. The survey team utilized methods set by the Center for Tropical Forest Science - Forest Global Earth Observatory, also known as CTFS-ForestGEO (condit_tropical_1998; Gonzalez‐Akre et al. 2016). Measurements of old, new multi-, and new plant stems are either measured or recruited at greater than or equal to 1 cm DBH (Bourg et al. 2013). “Old stems” are considered to be stems that existed in the previous census. These measurements also include old multistemed species. “New multi stems” are new stems that have grown on the same woody species as the old stem. Once their information is recorded, each stem is given a different colored wire/combination of colored wires to signify which stem it is. “New plant stems” are the new growth of species that have not been tagged in the plot yet. “Tagging” is when a woody species is marked with a specific identification number. These numbers are compiled within a spread sheet and logged into the global CTFS database. With the recruitment of new growth comes the acknowledgement of stem death. According to Gonzalez‐Akre et al. (2016), dead stems are considered to be dead due to the following criteria: (1) stems that are broken below DBH; (2) loosened or detached bark; (3) lack of development in regards to flower or leaf buds and; (4) signs of pests or pathogens such as fungus and insects. Four hectares of the plot is located in a fenced in area designed to keep Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) from entering the environment (Ramage et al. 2017). This fencing is locally known as the ‘deer exclosure.’ References "],
