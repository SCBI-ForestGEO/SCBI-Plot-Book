The amount of carbon held in by trees can have a negative impact due to the emissions that are released into the air caused by deforestation. The rise in carbon emissions is attributed to the rise in tree mortality. Mortality is one of the most important causes of forest dynamics (E. Gonzalez‐Akre et al. 2016), as it can influnce the number and distribution of woody species that are found in an area. It can also be detrimental because tree mortality can be used as an indication of climate change (E. Gonzalez‐Akre et al. 2016). In 1974, the Smithsonian purchased a piece of land, known as the Remount Depot. Shortly after the purchase, the land became the Conservation Research Center.The Front Royal site of the National Zoological Park is ~1,296 hectares (3,500 acres) and combined with research and academic facilities, forestry, pastures, and animal enclosures (ASK ERIKA OR KRISTA HOW TO CITE THE CULTURAL RESOUCE ASSESSMENT - Ayers et al. 2007).

(2013), is located at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Virginia, U.S.A. (38 degrees 53’36.6“N, 78 degrees 08’43.4”W). Elevations range from 273 to 338 meters above sea level (masl) (E. Gonzalez‐Akre et al. 2016), with a topographic relief of 65m (Bourg et al. 2013). Map of SCBI site relative to regional topography. Elevation labels in the grid are in masl. The SCBI site is within a region encompassing the northern section of the Blue Ridge Mountains and is a continuation of the Appalachian Mountain range. Shenandoah National Park (elevation range ~171 to ~1,234 masl) (Park Statistics - Shenandoah National Park (U.S. National Park Service) 2018) lies directly to the southwest while smaller hills (of which the site is comprised) extend to the northwest. To the east of the site, the smaller hills give way to the lower Piedmont region, while in the west, they give way to the Shenandoah Valley under the Massanutten Mountains. Because part of the site is situated within a small valley and most storms approach from the west and southwest, the site is relatively sheltered. Potential data to include: - NEON has topography, depth to water table, etc. 2.2 Climate The forest type across the 25.6-ha plot is homogeneously broadleaf, cold deciduous, with a mean annual temperature of 12.9 degrees C and a mean annual precipitation level of 1001 mm (K. J. Anderson‐Teixeira et al. 2015). According to the Koppen-Geiger biome classifcation, the plot falls within the Cfa zone, which is characterized as humid subtropical/midlatitude with significant precipitation year-round (K. J. Anderson‐Teixeira et al. (2015)). Primary disturbances at the SCBI site are natural and consist of wind and ice storms. Potential data to include: - SCBI weather tower - NEON - other (external) products here 2.3 Soils Potential data to include: - Data collected by Ben Turner - NEON data 2.4 Hydrology?

["methods.html", "Chapter3 Methods", " Chapter3 Methods This survey was conducted in the Center for Tropical Forest Science-Forest Global Earth Observatory’s (CTFS-ForestGEO) dynamic forest plot. The plot, itself, is located at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia, USA. SCBI is 3.1 miles (5 kilometers) from the Shenandoah National Park and roughly 80 miles (~130 kilometers) from the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. The research was conducted by a team of interns under the labs of William McShea, Ph.D and Kristina Anderson-Teixeira, Ph.D. On average, 3.3 people/day participated in the census with 3.7 field days/week. A single person logged an average of 29 hours/week, resulting in 97 hours/week being done. Roughly 3,200 total amount of work hours - including data collection, review, entry, and analysis - was completed. The survey team utilized methods set by the Center for Tropical Forest Science - Forest Global Earth Observatory, also known as CTFS-ForestGEO (Condit 1998; E. Gonzalez‐Akre et al. 2016). Measurements of old, new multi-, and new plant stems are either measured or recruited at greater than or equal to 1 cm DBH (Bourg et al. 2013). “Old stems” are considered to be stems that existed in the previous census. These measurements also include old multistemed species. “New multi stems” are new stems that have grown on the same woody species as the old stem. Once their information is recorded, each stem is given a different colored wire/combination of colored wires to signify which stem it is. “New plant stems” are the new growth of species that have not been tagged in the plot yet. “Tagging” is when a woody species is marked with a specific identification number. These numbers are compiled within a spread sheet and logged into the global CTFS database. With the recruitment of new growth comes the acknowledgement of stem death. According to E. Gonzalez‐Akre et al. (2016), dead stems are considered to be dead due to the following criteria: (1) stems that are broken below DBH; (2) loosened or detached bark; (3) lack of development in regards to flower or leaf buds and; (4) signs of pests or pathogens such as fungus and insects. Four hectares of the plot is located in a fenced in area designed to keep Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) from entering the environment (Ramage et al. 2017). This fencing is locally known as the ‘deer exclosure.’ References "],
