# Preface {-}
This is our first online release for the *SCBI ForestGEO Large Forest Dynamics Plot*, a preliminary version of an eventual printed release.  

Our goal is to present basic ecological and botanical data, tree distribution maps, and growth and mortality data on all woody species measured in the 5-year surveys in our 25.6 ha plot.
