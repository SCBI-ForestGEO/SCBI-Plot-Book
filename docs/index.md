# Preface {-}
This is our first online release for the *SCBI ForestGEO Large Forest Dynamics Book*, a preliminary version for an eventual printed release. 

Our goal is to present basic ecological and botanical data, tree distribution, and growth and mortality data on all woody species that are included in the 5-years surveys in our 25.6 ha plot.


This book was fuly written in R Markdown, using RStudio as text editor and the bookdown package (CITE). The source code is hosted on GitHub, at https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-Plot-Book.
