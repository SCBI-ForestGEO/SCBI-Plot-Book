# Preface {-}

This is the very first part of the book. An introduction to the importance of the book (maybe written by Stuart, Steve, Sean?).

This book is still in progress. Any suggestions or questions get in contact with us through [GitHub](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-Plot-Book/issues/new).
